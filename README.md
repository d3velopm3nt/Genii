# Genii

The DALMAPPER solution is made up of 2 main features.
1. DALX - This is a Data Access Layer with a ORM(Object Rational Mapper) that can be easily used in any application. The goal was to make it plug and play. No need to create a repository pattern and add contect class like EF.

2. GenX - This is a code generator that can be connected to a SQL Server Database to select tables that you want to generate code for. The application lets you generate multiple templates on one table that can be edited and re generated anytime.
